Here’s a full nursing note on “Normal Puerperium” in English, simple and exam-friendly:

⸻

🩺 Normal Puerperium

📘 Definition:

Puerperium is the period following childbirth, during which the mother’s body returns to its pre-pregnant state.
It usually lasts for about six weeks (42 days) after the delivery of the placenta.

⸻

⏳ Duration:

Approximately 6 weeks (42 days) —
from the delivery of the placenta to the restoration of normal reproductive and physiological functions.

⸻

⚙️ Physiological Changes During Puerperium

1. Uterus:
	•	Immediately after delivery, the uterus weighs about 1,000 g.
	•	It gradually reduces to 60–80 g within 6 weeks — this process is called involution.
	•	The uterine fundus descends about 1 cm per day after birth.
	•	By the 10th day, it is no longer palpable abdominally.

⸻

2. Lochia:
	•	Vaginal discharge after childbirth, containing blood, mucus, and tissue debris.
Types:
	•	Lochia rubra (1–3 days): red, mainly blood.
	•	Lochia serosa (4–10 days): pink or brownish.
	•	Lochia alba (after 10 days): whitish or yellow, mostly mucus and leukocytes.

⸻

3. Cervix and Vagina:
	•	Cervix becomes soft and gradually regains its normal shape by the end of the second week.
	•	Vagina regains tone within 3–4 weeks.
	•	Rugae reappear by 3rd week.

⸻

4. Abdominal Wall:
	•	Muscles are soft and flabby after delivery.
	•	Tone returns gradually with exercises.

⸻

5. Breasts:
	•	Become full and tense due to milk secretion (lactation) within 2–3 days after birth.
	•	Prolactin helps in milk production and oxytocin helps in milk ejection.

⸻

6. Urinary System:
	•	Increased urine output (diuresis) in first few days.
	•	Bladder tone returns to normal in a few days.

⸻

7. Gastrointestinal System:
	•	Constipation is common due to decreased bowel tone and pain after delivery.

⸻

8. Cardiovascular System:
	•	Blood volume and cardiac output gradually return to normal within 2 weeks.

⸻

9. Endocrine System:
	•	Hormones like estrogen and progesterone fall rapidly.
	•	Prolactin remains high in lactating women.

⸻

💊 Nursing Care During Normal Puerperium
	1.	Observe vital signs regularly.
	2.	Monitor lochia, uterine involution, and perineal wound.
	3.	Maintain perineal hygiene to prevent infection.
	4.	Support breastfeeding and nipple care.
	5.	Encourage early ambulation and exercises.
	6.	Provide adequate rest and nutrition.
	7.	Offer emotional support and health education.

⸻

🩷 Conclusion:

The puerperium is a critical recovery period for the mother.
Proper nursing care, hygiene, rest, and breastfeeding support help restore the mother’s physical and emotional health.
